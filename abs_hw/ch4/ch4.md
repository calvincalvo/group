####What is [ ]?
The empty brackets represent a list value.
####How would you assign the value `hello` as the third value in a list stored in a variable named `spam`? (Assume `spam` contains [2,4,6,8,10]).
`spam[3] = 'hello'`
####*For the following three questions, letâ€™s say `spam` contains the list `['a','b', 'c', 'd']`.*
####What does `spam[int('3'*2)/11]` evaluate to?
####What does `spam[-1]` evaluate to?
`'d'`
####What does `spam[:2]` evaluate to?
`['a', 'b']`
####*For the following three questions, let's say `bacon` contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]*
####What does `bacon.index('cat')` evaluate to?
1
####What does `bacon.append(99)` make the list value in bacon look like?
`[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]`
####What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
`[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]`
####What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
`+`, `*`
####What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
`append()` will add the new list value to the end of the existing list; insert() will insert the value at the specified index.
####What are two ways to remove values from a list?
One way is to use the `del` statement; another is to use the `remove()` method.
####Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
